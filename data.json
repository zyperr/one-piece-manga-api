After Shanks comes into conflict with Higuma, the mountain bandit, at a bar, it is revealed that Luffy accidentally ate a Devil Fruit: the Gomu Gomu no Mi. Later on, after Luffy provokes Higuma, he is taken hostage. Shanks and his crew show up and defeat Higuma's bandits, but Higuma escapes, taking Luffy on a boat. After Higuma kicks Luffy into the water, a Sea King appears and eats Higuma, and Shanks arrives just in time to save Luffy's life. Shanks scares away the Sea King, but loses his arm in the process. Because Shanks sacrificed his left arm in order to save him, Luffy becomes even more determined to become a pirate. Before Shanks leaves, he gives Luffy his straw hat. Ten years later, Luffy officially sets sail as a pirate and begins the adventure to fulfill his dream of becoming the Pirate King.\n",

Meanwhile, Royal Army Commander Dalton expressed concern about the state of the country, recalling his time at the Levely where Wapol's immature actions contrasted with the mature gracefulness of the ten-year-old Nefertari Vivi. Hiriluk wished to cure the people of Drum Island of all their sicknesses, including the ones in their hearts, and Chopper decided to help him despite his wishes. They worked together for a year, but after Chopper was fully healed, Hiriluk forced him back to the wild.\n",

After an abnormal amount of time, Luffy realizes his situation and flees the restaurant, not realizing the presence of Ace. While the Marines are pursuing Luffy, the rest of the crew has bought some local clothes (much to Sanji's delight) in order to blend in.

Luffy escapes the quicksand and tries to attack Crocodile several times, but Crocodile is not effected. Crocodile attacks Luffy and makes his hand wither with his power, which makes Luffy panic. Luffy remembers the water Toto gave him and revives himself, yelling that Toto stated Yuba would never lose to sand. Luffy uses a new technique that probably comes from Wapol and eats the top half of Crocodile, which enrages him. Crocodile tells Luffy to die along with Yuba, and creates a sandstorm. Meanwhile in Rainbase, people worries about the sandstorm they see. Tashigi tells Smoker about it, which he simply looks on at. On Hasami, the rest of the Straw Hats also talk about the sandstorm. Vivi tells them that it is \"him\". Back at the scene, Crocodile tells Luffy his intentions on sending this sandstorm to Yuba, which enrages Luffy. Luffy tries to stop Crocodile, but gets stabbed by Crocodile's hook. Crocodile tells Luffy that rookies like him are swarming all over the Grand Line.\n",

She also finds out that the Shandia's battle for the protection of the bell has long been won and that Gol D. Roger knew how to read Poneglyphs. Robin then arrives with the Shandia and the Straw Hats think they are chasing after them, so they make a run for it. The Shandia are confused as to why the Straw Hats would want to run away and not want to take their offering of a gold pillar. Robin laughs and says that it's possible that they don't want it anymore. The Straw Hats continue running away.\n",

Ace remembers his adventure in the Grand Line, fighting Jinbe and later losing to Whitebeard. Ace then remembers how he became a member of the Whitebeard Pirates after trying to kill Whitebeard numerous times, and eventually became a commander. Finally, Ace recalls when Marshall D. Teach killed Thatch and Ace went to capture him against his captain's wishes. Back at Marineford, Ace yells that getting captured was his own fault, but Whitebeard says that he told him to go. Ace tries to argue, but his crew says that no one touches a member of their crew and gets away with it. Whitebeard's attack then arrives in the form of two huge tsunamis, beginning the Summit War of Marineford.\n",

He then goes on to attack Whitebeard, who counter attacks and demolishes Aokiji, causing him to start falling into the ocean. Aokiji freezes the ocean before he is submerged, immobilizing the ships but also creating some footing. All 14 commanders then rush out of the ship and charge into the war, leading the rest of the allies. The pirates start to open fire onto Marineford, but their attacks are blocked by the Vice-Admirals. Dracule Mihawk decides to test his strength against Whitebeard, but his attempt is stopped by Jozu, revealing his power.

He then tells the giant squad to look out for attacks in the sky, who start advancing. They are then stopped by Jozu, who hurls a giant iceberg towards them, noticeably much larger than the giants. Admiral Akainu appears in the path of the iceberg, showing his power, then launching a magma attack in the shape of his fist to the iceberg. The iceberg immediately evaporates, while also sending volcanic projectiles crashing down onto the advancing pirates. One of Whitebeard's ships is sunk, and some also approach the Moby Dick, but are stopped by Whitebeard's bisento. The war rages on, showing some of the powers of the pirates.

Angered by the callous disregard of the lives of his men, Brownbeard tries to reveal Caesar's true nature to the rest of the men protecting their \"generous\" master, but Caesar secretly injects a muscle relaxant into Brownbeard, making him spurt gibberish and be unable to stand. Now in control of the situation, Caesar whispers to Brownbeard that the poison gas incident was his doing. Brownbeard then furiously tries to attack Caesar, only to be shot down by the subordinates he swore to save. Feeling victorious, Caesar prepares to finish off Brownbeard, but a giant Haki-infused fist stops him.\n",

Franky sees Zoro who informs him that he will try to slow down the strings. Doflamingo, after recovering from Luffy's assault, creates a large amount of strings from the environment claiming that his \"awakening\" allows his Devil Fruit powers to evolve past their limitations. Everywhere, the people of Dressrosa are lost in despair until they hear an announcement from King Riku begging them to live on until the nightmare is over, renewing their hope. Luffy, running out of time to be in Gear 4, pushes his way out of Doflamingo's massive string attack and delivers one final attack on the Warlord, sending him crashing into the mountainside.\n",

Meanwhile, while celebrating with the minks, the Curly Hat Pirates learned that their pursuers had caught up with them. Caesar begged Sanji not to hand him, revealing that Big Mom commissioned some research from him, but he simply swindled her funds while hiding behind Doflamingo's protection. Sanji and Brook eventually confronted the new arrivals; to their surprise, Pekoms was grateful to the Straw Hats for saving his homeland and offered to spare them from the consequences of a second, new mission if they handed over Caesar. However, Bege shot Pekoms for disobeying Big Mom's orders, before ordering his men out of his body and instructing them to surround the Straw Hats.\n",

Oden happily set off, and Kin'emon and Denjiro decided to become his followers. The trio went to Hakumai to meet with the daimyo Shimotsuki Yasuie, who introduced them to his new servant Kurozumi Orochi.\n",

One day, Oden went off and confronted the criminals in Kuri, culminating in him defeating the most dangerous criminal Ashura Doji. He then decided he wanted to take over the region, and worked with his followers to round up the criminals and restore order. Once this had been accomplished, Sukiyaki reinstated Oden as his son and made him the daimyo of Kuri. Oden, needing retainers as a daimyo, decided to grant the position to his followers.\n",

Whitebeard decided to allow Oden to join if he could ride the chain for three days, but Oden, when there were only ten minutes left, ended up drifting away. He washed ashore on an island, scaring away a band of human traffickers who had tried to kidnap a woman named Amatsuki Toki by promising to take her to Wano. After Toki treated his wounds, Oden defended her when the traffickers came back with their leader Karma. However, Whitebeard then came and took out Karma as he offered for Oden to join him, being impressed with his willingness to protect Toki.\n",

Law manages to get to Big Mom and penetrate her with his K-ROOM-enhanced sword, which he stretches down all the way to the Wano mainland many kilometers below. He then unleashes another shockwave which harms Big Mom and opens a hole below her. Before Big Mom can unleash a counterattack, Kid comes in with a gun made out of magnetized scrap metal and fires a laser at her, blasting her into the hole with nothing between her and the mainland.\n",

Law then creates a soundless area (much like Corazon's Devil Fruit power) around Big Mom, and as Kid forces her down a hole, Big Mom is left unable to call her homies to save her. She lands in the Armory and inadvertently triggers a bomb which causes Kazenbo to wither away and blows away the remaining ground behind her. Big Mom then proceeds to fall all the way to the Wano mainland, where she is left defeated in a huge explosion; the fighters around Law and Kid are left in awe and jubilation at their victory over an Emperor of the Sea.\n",
